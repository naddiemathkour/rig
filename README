This directory details some simple steps to creating HTTP servers in GO.

The implementations are barebones mvp's for several different approaches
to creating HTTP servers. The purpose of this exercise is to better familiarize
yourself with the steps that are needed to create a backend server in GO.

Many of the principals exibited by the process of creating a back-end in GO are
transferable to other languages.

The focus of these servers is to provide REST API functionality for CRUD 
requirements of a project.

To start a server, simply build the go program and run the executable.

To test the server, run the included 'http.sh' file that includes shell
commands for pinging the running server on localhost:8080. This file was
created via the following steps:
  
  1. Install httpie: 
    sudo apt install httpie
  
  2. Create the http.sh file:
    touch http.sh

  3. Open the http.sh file and add a shebang on the first line:
    #!/bin/bash

  4. Add your httpie test calls beneath the shebang:
    http GET http://localhost:8080/
    http GET http://localhost:8080/users
    etc.

  5. Make the http.sh file executable:
    chmod +x http.sh

  6. Run the executable http.sh file to execute all httpie requests:
    ./http.sh
